# Now we create the page on which pens will draw.
# Set its size to 400 by 400, set its colors to PALETURQUOISE,
# set the tracer to 0 (increase the value of the tracer to increase the animation speed).
# Do not delete this line, but change if you like.
euclid.createPage(size = (400, 400), color = PALETURQUOISE, tracer = 0)

# Next we create a pen name logos.
# Its color is VIOLETRED, it begins at position (160, 240)
# and direction 0 (which is directly right).
# The delay of 6 slows it down a bit; decrease delay to increase animation speed.
# Do not  delete, but change if you like.
# You may also create additional pens.
logos = euclid.Pen(color = VIOLETRED, position = (160, 240), direction = 0, delay = 6)

# Now we create functions that will draw with our pen.
# My example draws an equilateral triangle.
def triangle(s, x, y):
  # s is the side length of the triangle.
  # (x, y) are the coordinates of its lower left corner.
  logos.up() # pick up pen so it wont draw when we move
  logos.goto(x, y) # position logos at (x, y)
  logos.down() # put pen back down so it will now draw
  for i in range(3): # range(3) because 3 sides
     logos.forward(s) # draw a side 
     logos.turn(120)

# Write your functions here.



# Call the triangle function.
triangle(50, 100, 80)
time.sleep(3) # pause for 3 seconds
euclid.clear() # clear the screen

# Call each of your functions here.
# Place a short pause between each.
# time.sleep(3) will pause for 3 seconds,
# which seems reasonable.
# After each pause, do euclid.clear()
# to clear the screen.



# Now finish any as yet incomplete parts of the animation
# and keep the window open.
euclid.finish()
euclid.wait()
